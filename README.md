# GAME INFO	

The main menu displays the user with 3 options; to start a new game, load their previous game or view info about the game.
Starting a new game the user choses a unique username which they can save their progress to at anytime to later load and continue their game.

The main objective is for the bomberman `Man` to eliminate all the enemies in the level's map;
whilst exploring the map and blasting boxes `Box` to find the "exit door" in the given time. Randomly hidden inside the boxes are some upgrades that 
enhance the bomberman's abilites; so the idea is to navigate the map `Map` and eliminate the enemies strategically as the boxes
are what restrict movement.

There are 2 different types of enemies `Enemy` in the game, the first one being Pacman `<` which is a slower enemy that moves horizontally and switches 
directions randomly. The other enemy is Dollar`$` which is slightly faster and moves vertically.

To eliminate the enemies the bomberman has 2 main weapons `Bomb` in his arsenal; he can either drop a normal bomb `BombA` which detonates after a countdown
of 2 seconds, or he can drop a remote bomb `BombB` which he can detonate from anywhere at anytime.

Once an enemy is eliminated the bomberman can bump up his score by collecting their points.

The stats window ontop of the map displays the current stats of the bomberman's arsenal aswell as that of the game, such as the time countdown,
the bomberman's bomb & remote powers aswell as how many he can drop/carry at a time.

Below the map is a message window that displays useful information and hints throughout the game, such as how many upgrades are hidden in the map and 
the position of the exit door if the time is close to running out.

Bombs block the enemy and player's movement; boxes block a bomb's effect as they blast and absorb the damage. Therefore enemies and the bomberman
are safe from the effect if they're behind a wall or a box when a bomb detonates.
The bomberman loses a life if he is caught by an enemy or is in the range of a detonating bomb, so adjust you terminal font size to 24 and choose wisely.
